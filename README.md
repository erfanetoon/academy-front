Use `Tailwind` and `Material UI` for design and structure

It's `Multi Languages` app that phrases and all texts handle from server(SSR) and handle `RTL` direction

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
